# AI-Driven Meeting Summarizer

## Objective :

Create an AI-powered feature for a B2B enterprise that processes meeting transcripts to
generate concise summaries, extract actionable items, and assign tasks. The tool should
analyze conversational data (e.g., from mock sales or project meetings) and produce clear
outputs to streamline follow-ups for teams in a fictional B2B company (e.g., a consulting firm

## managing client projects).

## Challenges :

- **Accurate Extraction** : Identify and extract relevant action items and key points from
    unstructured, conversational meeting transcripts.
- **Context Understanding** : Ensure the AI captures nuanced discussions and assigns
    tasks correctly, avoiding misinterpretation of ambiguous dialogue.
- **Summarization Quality** : Produce concise, coherent summaries that are useful for
    enterprise teams without losing critical details.
- **User-Friendly Output** : Present summaries and action items in a clear, actionable
    format for busy professionals.
- **Time Constraint** : Build a functional prototype within two days, prioritizing accurate NLP
    processing and output delivery.

## Deliverables :

- A working prototype that processes mock meeting transcripts and generates summaries,
    action items, and task assignments.
- A 3-5 minute demo video showcasing:
    o Inputting a mock meeting transcript (text or simulated audio).
    o Displaying the generated summary and extracted action items.
    o Showing task assignments for team members in a B2B context.
    o Highlighting the tool’s value for improving meeting efficiency in an enterprise
       setting.

## Evaluation Criteria :

- **Functionality** : Does the tool accurately summarize meetings and extract actionable
    items?


- **Accuracy** : How well does the AI interpret conversational data and assign tasks
    correctly?
- **Clarity** : Is the demo video effective in showcasing the tool’s outputs and their relevance
    to B2B teams?
- **Completeness** : Does the prototype deliver core summarization and task extraction
    features within the two-day timeframe?

**Impact** : Does the solution demonstrate clear value for enhancing productivity in a B2B

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Backend Won't Start
```bash
# Check Python version (need 3.11+)
python --version

# Check if port 8000 is free
netstat -an | findstr :8000

# Kill process if needed
taskkill /F /PID <PID>

# Try different port
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001
```

#### Frontend Won't Start
```bash
# Check Node.js version (need 18+)
node --version

# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Check if port 3000 is free
netstat -an | findstr :3000
```

#### AI Models Not Loading
```bash
# Download models manually
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('stopwords')"
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

# Check internet connection
ping huggingface.co
```

#### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Check if PostgreSQL is running
# Windows: Check Services
# Linux/Mac: sudo systemctl status postgresql

# Test connection
python -c "from database import test_connection; test_connection()"
```
